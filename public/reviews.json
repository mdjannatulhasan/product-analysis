In fact, the laptop's fans only turned on while exporting a 4K video file.",

Electric shocks from the mouse pad, sticky keys, the camera stopped working and less than average picture quality. When I contact Mac support they offer solutions that don't work but require me to close down the computer.",

It offers amazing performance, even on battery, and comes with the best screen you’ll find on a laptop anywhere. For day-to-day use, this won’t be the laptop for you, but for video editors, programmers, music producers and photographers, you won’t get a better laptop.",
